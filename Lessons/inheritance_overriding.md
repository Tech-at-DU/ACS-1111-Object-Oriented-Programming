```python
# Superclass - Parent
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def introduce_self(self):
    print(f"My name is {self.name} and my age is {self.age}.")


# create two people and have them introduce themselves
person_1 = Person("Adriana", "28")
person_1.introduce_self()

person_2 = Person("Braus", "32")
person_2.introduce_self()

# create Student class

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, name, age, major):
    super().__init__(name, age)
    self.major = major
  
  def study(self):
    print(f"{self.name} studies {self.major}")

  def introduce_self(self):
    super(Student, self).introduce_self()
    print(f"I major in {self.major}")
    
# create a Student and have them introduce themselves

student_1 = Student("Danika", "28", "Computer Science")
student_1.introduce_self()
```

## Challenges 

- Create a a Musician class that extends Person
- Muscians should have a favorite song. Musician class should have a favorite_song attribute that is initialized when an instance is created. 
- A muscian should have a method called hum_tune. When this method is called you should print: "{name} hums {favorite_sing}" 
- When a musician introduces themself they say: "My name is {name} and my age is {age}." and "my favorite song is {favorite_sing}".
