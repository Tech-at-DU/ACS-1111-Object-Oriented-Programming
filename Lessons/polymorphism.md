```python
'''
In the code below, we created a Shark class and a Clownfish class, each of which will define methods for swim(), swim_backwards(), and skeleton().

They share three methods in common with the same name. However, each of the functionalities of these methods differ for each class.

  def swim_backwards(self):
      print("The shark cannot swim backwards, but can sink backwards.")

  def skeleton(self):
      print("The shark's skeleton is made of cartilage.")

class Clownfish():
  def swim(self):
      print("The clownfish is swimming.")
