# A Team is not a Player is not a Team!

# Note! Team owns a list of PLayers. Team can communicate 
# with Player in the the list. See the roster method. 

# On the other hand Player has no way to to communicate 
# with its Team. That is unless we provide that mechanism!

# Look at the Player's team attribute. Look at the the 
# Team's add_player method. Here, each time a player is 
# added to the team that players team attribute is set 
# to the team object.

  <!-- * Coding Exercise 5: [https://repl.it/@MakeSchool/DeckCardsComposition#main.py](https://repl.it/@MakeSchool/DeckCardsComposition#main.py) -->

## Challenge!

You need to create two classes. One will represent a playing card. The other will represent a deck of cards. 

A deck of cards has 52 cards in four suits and two colors. Suits are: 

- ‚ô†Ô∏è Spades
- ‚ô£Ô∏è Clubs
- ‚ô•Ô∏è Hearts
- ‚ô¶Ô∏è Diamonds

Values range from 1-13. 

Stretch challenge values range from Ace, 2-10, Jack, Jack, Queen, King. 

Color is either Red for Hearts and Diamonds, or black for Spades and Clubs. 

**Card** class will have attributes of:

- suit - The suit
- value - the value
- color - the color

Card will also have a `show()` method that prints the value and suit. 

**Deck** class will have attributes of: 

- `cards` - a list of Card instances 

Deck will have methods of: 

- `create_deck()` - populates the cards list with cards. You need 52 cards 1-13 in value for each of the four suits. 
- `shuffle()` - randomzies the list of cards. Note! You can use `random.shuffle()` from the built in python library. 

**Stretch Challenges**

- Add a `draw()` method to the `Deck` class. This method returns the first card in the cards list and returns it. 
- Add a `discard_pile` attribute to the `Deck` class. This property is a list that holds cards that were discarded. 
- Add a `discard()` method that takes a card and adds it to the discard list. 
- Every card should know what deck it belongs to. Add a `deck` attribute to the `Card` class. When a card is created set it's `deck` to the deck that created it. 
- Give `Card` a discard method. This method should add that card to it's deck's discard pile. A card can call discard on it's deck and pass it self as an argument!
- Create a `Hand` class. A had class is like a small deck. It stores a list of `cards` in an attribute. It also has a `deck` attribute that is the deck that the hand was drawn from.
- Add a `draw_hand()` method to the `Deck` class. This method should return a new instance of the `Hand` class and populate it with 7 cards. 
- The `Hand` class needs a draw method. This method calls `draw` on the deck the hand is working with and adds the returned card to the hand's cards list. 
- A `Hand` needs a `discard_random()` method. This method chooses a random card in the hand's cards list and passes it to it's deck's discard method. 
- Add a `discard()` method to the `Hand` class. This method takes the index of a card in the cards list and discards that card.
